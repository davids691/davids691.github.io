      </p>
      Citra's genetic index is predominantly Afric. Scythe Curie used to braid her hair which implies her hair is long enough to braid.
      </p>
        Personality: 
      </p>
      Citra is very clever, although she can be short-tempered and rude at times. She is also very caring, accepting her scythe apprenticeship to ensure her brother and parent's immunity from gleaning. Citra is competitive and loves to win. She is an extremely loyal person, strives for justice, realistic, and hates corruption. During her apprenticeship, she develops more empathy, compassion, and kindness for others, which is reflected in her gleaning method. Despite being a world-famous scythe, she hates being the center of attention, but always handles it well, knowing what to say.
      </p>
        Traits: 
      </p>
      Citra is known for her unwavering focus and determination. She is a hard worker who is always striving to improve herself and her skills. She is also fiercely loyal to those she cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them. However, her strong will can sometimes make her appear cold or aloof to others, and she can be prone to taking risks that others might consider reckless. Overall, Citra is a force to be reckoned with, and she will stop at nothing to achieve her goals.

        way of gleaning: 
        </p>
        Scythe Anastasia allows people to choose their own method of gleaning and gives them notice ahead of time. Her method is to choose a subject and research it thoroughly, then approach them, inform them they have been selected for gleaning, then proceed to inject them with a hypodermic gun containing a grain of lethal poison that activates if they tried to leave MidMerica to escape their gleaning or if they do not contact Anastasia within the next thirty days to let her know where and how they would like to be gleaned. She gives them one month to put their lives in order and to say their goodbyes; with this she searches to give her gleaning subjects a moment of perspective and for them to find completion. Then, she gives them her business card, turquoise ink on a white background, with simply her name "Scythe Anastasia," and a phone number reserved exclusively for her gleaning subjects.If they lose the card, they must call the general number for the MidMerican scythedom, choose option three, and follow the Scythe Anastasia's argument to the accusations was that, in her studies of the mortal age, she had learned that for many people, death was not instantaneous. Some diseases gave people warning, time to prepare themselves and their loved ones for the inevitable. Since it violated no laws, and the Parliamentarian couldn't find grounds for legal objection, they could not put her on probation, and she was allowed to keep gleaning with her method.Only a handful of her subjects didn't return at the end of their grace period. Some tried to cross the border to Texas or WestMerica and died in the process. No one was allowed to touch the body until Anastasia arrived to pronounce them gleaned. Others simply waited for the time to run out and were found dead in their beds. In all instances, the method of death had been entirely the choice of the subject, which was most crucial for Scythe Anastasia. She found it indignant to have your death chosen for you. It created more work for her, but it helped her sleep at night.
