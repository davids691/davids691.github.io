        <h2>citra's journals</h2>
      <p>Have we ever had an enemy worse than ourselves? In the Age of
        Mortality we warred ceaselessly with one another, and when there
        was no war to be made, we beat down one another in our streets,
        our schools, our homes, until war turned our gaze outward again,
        placing the enemy at a more comfortable distance.
        But all such conflict is a thing of the past. There is peace on Earth,
        good will toward all humankind.
        Except . . .
        And that’s the thing: There is always an exception. I haven’t been
        a scythe for long, but I can already see that the Scythedom is in
        danger of becoming that exception. Not just here in MidMerica, but
        worldwide.
        The first scythes were true visionaries and saw the wisdom of
        continuing to cultivate wisdom. They understood that the soul of a
        scythe needed to remain pure. Free from malice and greed and
        pride, but filled with conscience. However, rot grows on even the
        sturdiest of foundations.
        If the conscience of the Scythedom fails, replaced by the avarice of
        privilege, we could become our own worst enemy again. And to
        complicate it, new wrinkles are being added to the fabric of the
        Scythedom every day. Take, for instance, the latest rumor, which in
        the months since I was ordained has spread beyond the Scythedom
        and is whispered among the general population.
        According to the rumor, there is someone out there who is seeking
        out corrupt, despicable scythes . . . and ending their existence by
        fire. One thing is certain: He’s not an ordained scythe. And yet
        people have started to call him Scythe Lucifer.
        I’m terrified that it might be true—but more terrified that I might
        want it to be true.
        It was never my desire to be a scythe. I suppose that might make
        me a good one. I don’t yet know, because it’s all so new and I still
        have so much to learn. For now I must give all my attention to
        gleaning with compassion and conscience, with hopes that it will
        help our perfect world stay perfect.
        And if ever Scythe Lucifer comes my way, I hope he’ll see me as
        one of the good ones. The way he once did.
        —From the gleaning jounal of H.S. Anastasia
