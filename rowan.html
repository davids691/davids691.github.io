        discription: 
      </p>
      Rowan has dark hair and lightly freckled skin. Due to his training with Scythe Faraday, and later Scythe Goddard, he is extremely physically fit. Through his extensive and brutal apprenticeship, Rowan gained the skills necessary to become Scythe Lucifer.
      </p>
        personality: 
      </p>
      In the beginning it showed that Rowan didn’t do things because they were right, but because it made someone happy. Rowan is selfless and empathetic. Rowan is still a teenager, having a crush on Citra, and looks at a girl during Goddard’s party. While training under Scythe Goddard, he enjoyed training his skills, which he hated himself for because it was killcraft. He pretended to go along with Godddard, but when Volta self-gleaned - Goddard calling Volta weak and wanted him to kill a Tonist curate - he became Scythe Lucifer. Rowan is emotional - wanting to see Citra, crying after his father’s gleaning - he just believes in his way of saving the scythedom. Rowan goes through a lot of pain, thinking of Citra to sweeten the moment, or just wanting to be numb.

        way of gleaning: 
      </p>
      Scythe Lucifer only gleans corrupt scythes. His victims had a merciful death and were consumed by fire under mysterious circumstances. He didn’t glean Scythe Brahms, only to have the courage to see Citra. After his visit with Faraday, he decided to change his style, and give the corrupt scythes a chance to change their ways, but if they kept their corrupt ways he would glean them. After knowing Scythe Brahms killed his father, he goes after him in anger (being caught). He doesn't take requests, but the LoneStar scythes convince him to.
