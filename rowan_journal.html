        <h2>rowan's journals</h2>
      <p>A year ago if you’d told me that I’d know how to wield more than
        two dozen types of blades, that I would become an expert at
        firearms, and that I would know at least ten ways to end a life with
        my bare hands—I would have laughed and suggested that you ought
        to get your brain chemistry tweaked. Amazing what can happen in
        just a few short months.
        Training under Scythe Goddard is different from under Scythe
        Faraday. It’s intense, physical, and I can’t deny that I’m getting better
        at everything I do. If I am a weapon, then I’m being sharpened
        against a grindstone every day.
        My second conclave is coming up in a few weeks. The first trial
        was nothing more than a simple question. I’m told it will be different
        this next time. There’s no telling what the apprentices will be
        expected to do. One thing’s for sure, there will be serious
        consequences for me if I don’t perform to Goddard’s liking.
        I have every confidence that I will.
        —From the journal of Rowan Damisch, scythe apprentice
        </p>
        <p>
          I am apprenticed to a monster. Scythe Faraday was right:
        Someone who enjoys killing should never be a scythe. It goes against
        everything the founders wanted. If this is what the Scythedom is
        turning into, someone has to stop it. But it can’t be me. Because I
        think I’m becoming a monster, too.
        Rowan looked at what he wrote and carefully, quietly tore the page out,
        crumpled it, and tossed it into the flames of his bedroom fireplace. Goddard
        always read his journal. As Rowan’s mentor, it was his prerogative to do so. It
        had taken forever for Rowan to learn how to write his true thoughts, his true
        feelings. Now he had to learn to hide them again. It was a matter of survival.
        So he picked up his pen and wrote a new official entry.
        </p>
        <p>
        Today I killed twelve moving targets using only
        twelve bullets, and saved the life of my friend. Scythe
        Goddard sure knows how to motivate someone to do
        their best. There’s no denying that I’m getting better.
        I’m learning more and more each day, perfecting my
        mind, my body, and my aim. Scythe Goddard is proud
        of my progress. Someday I hope I can repay him, and
        give him what he deserves in return for all he’s done
        for me
        </p>
