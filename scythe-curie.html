      <p>
        name: Susan Wildblood

      </p>

        discription: Scythe Curie is tall, slim, and described herself as gangly. She has long silver hair that's usually braided and falls along the back of her robe dangling halfway to the ground. She wears a pale lavender robe. Scythe Curie, like everyone else, sets her biological age back but never sets it back past the age of 40. Her eyes are gray, but once were dyed lavender, like her robe. Her robe was once bright purple with a lavender lining.
      </p>
        personality: She describes herself in her early days as somewhat turbulent, earning the name "Little Miss Massacre." But as she became a more understanding and mature scythe, she earned the nickname "The Grande Dame of Death." She is intense, and with age she has grown into her intensity. Curie is incredibly against her fame and public perception as a celebrity, questioning why people treat her as a celebrity and swatting away people attempting to touch her robe.
      </p>
        traits: ???
      </p>
        gender: female
      </p>
        hobby: The kitchen is well equipped since Scythe Curie's hobby is cooking.
      </p>
        household: falling water
      </p>
        genetic index: ???
      </p>
        way of gleaning: Scythe Curie prefers to glean in small towns, she observes the crowd for someone who looks "stagnant", someone who looks like they don't care anymore and have given up. Those are the ones she gleans, without warning, imitating how death sometimes came in the Age of Mortality. After gleaning, she finds the immediate family of the gleaning subject and invites them to Fallingwater, the place where she resides with Citra, to grant them immunity and provide solace. Curie never gleans children. She said she never found one that looked stagnant, but even so, she stated she wouldn't do it. This has landed her a scolding sometimes, but never a punishment.
