      <p>We must, by law, keep a record of the innocents we kill.
        And as I see it, they’re all innocents. Even the guilty. Everyone is
        guilty of something, and everyone still harbors a memory of
        childhood innocence, no matter how many layers of life wrap around
        it. Humanity is innocent; humanity is guilty, and both states are
        undeniably true.
        We must, by law, keep a record.
        It begins on day one of apprenticeship—but we do not officially
        call it “killing.” It’s not socially or morally correct to call it such. It is,
        and has always been, “gleaning,” named for the way the poor
        would trail behind farmers in ancient times, taking the stray stalks of
        grain left behind. It was the earliest form of charity. A scythe’s work
        is the same. Every child is told from the day he or she is old enough
        to understand that the scythes provide a crucial service for society.
        Ours is the closest thing to a sacred mission the modern world knows.
        Perhaps that is why we must, by law, keep a record. A public
        journal, testifying to those who will never die and those who are yet
        to be born, as to why we human beings do the things we do. We are
        instructed to write down not just our deeds but our feelings, because
        it must be known that we do have feelings. Remorse. Regret. Sorrow
        too great to bear. Because if we didn’t feel those things, what
        monsters would we be?

        It is the most difficult thing a person can be asked to do. And
        knowing that it is for the greater good doesn’t make it any easier.
        People used to die naturally. Old age used to be a terminal affliction,
        not a temporary state. There were invisible killers called “diseases”
        that broke the body down. Aging couldn’t be reversed, and there
        were accidents from which there was no return. Planes fell from the
        sky. Cars actually crashed. There was pain, misery, despair. It’s hard
        for most of us to imagine a world so unsafe, with dangers lurking in
        every unseen, unplanned corner. All of that is behind us now, and
        yet a simple truth remains: People have to die.
        It’s not as if we can go somewhere else; the disasters on the moon
        and Mars colonies proved that. We have one very limited world, and
        although death has been defeated as completely as polio, people still
        must die. The ending of human life used to be in the hands of nature.
        But we stole it. Now we have a monopoly on death. We are its sole
        distributor.
        I understand why there are scythes, and how important and how
        necessary the work is . . . but I often wonder why I had to be chosen.
        And if there is some eternal world after this one, what fate awaits a
        taker of lives?

        2042. It’s a year that every schoolchild knows. It was the year where
        computational power became infinite—or so close to infinite that it
        could no longer be measured. It was the year we knew. . .
        everything. “The cloud” evolved into “the Thunderhead,” and now all
        there is to know about everything resides in the near-infinite memory
        of the Thunderhead for anyone who wants to access it.
        But like so many things, once we had possession of infinite
        knowledge, it suddenly seemed less important. Less urgent. Yes, we
        know everything, but I often wonder if anyone bothers to look at all
        that knowledge. There are academics, of course, who study what we
        already know, but to what end? The very idea of schooling used to
        be about learning so that we could improve our lives and the world.
        But a perfect world needs no improvement. Like most everything else
        we do, education, from grade school through the highest of
        universities, is just a way to keep us busy.
        2042 is the year we conquered death, and also the year we
        stopped counting. Sure, we still numbered years for a few more
        decades, but at the moment of immortality, passing time ceased to
        matter.
        I don’t know exactly when things switched over to the Chinese
        calendar—Year of the Dog, Year of the Goat, the Dragon, and so
        on. And I can’t exactly say when animal activists around the world
        began calling for equal billing for their own favorite species, adding
        in Year of the Otter, and the Whale, and the Penguin. And I couldn’t
        tell you when they stopped repeating, and when it was decreed that
        every year henceforth would be named after a different species. All I
        know for sure is that this is the Year of the Ocelot.
        As for the things I don’t know, I’m sure they’re all up there in the
        Thunderhead for anyone with the motivation to look.

        I had my cultural audit today. It happens only once a year, but it’s
        never any less stressful. This year, when they crunched each cultural
        index from those I gleaned over the past twelve months, I, thankfully,
        came up well within accepted parameters:
        20 percent Caucasoid
        18 percent Afric
        20 percent PanAsian
        19 percent Mesolatino
        23 percent Other
        Sometimes it’s hard to know. A person’s index is considered
        private, so we can only go by visible traits, which are no longer as
        obvious as they had been in past generations. When scythes’
        numbers become lopsided, they are disciplined by the High Blade,
        and are assigned their gleanings for the next year rather than being
        allowed to choose for themselves. It is a sign of shame.
        The index is supposed to keep the world free from cultural and
        genetic bias, but aren’t there underlying factors that we can’t escape?
        For instance, who decided that the first number of one’s genetic index
        would be Caucasoid?

        The greatest achievement of the human race was not conquering
        death. It was ending government.
        Back in the days when the world’s digital network was called “the
        cloud,” people thought giving too much power to an artificial
        intelligence would be a very bad idea. Cautionary tales abounded in
        every form of media. The machines were always the enemy. But then
        the cloud evolved into the Thunderhead, sparking with consciousness,
        or at least a remarkable facsimile. In stark contrast to people’s fears,
        the Thunderhead did not seize power. Instead, it was people who
        came to realize that it was far better suited to run things than
        politicians.
        In those days before the Thunderhead, human arrogance, selfinterest, and endless in-fighting determined the rule of law. Inefficient.
        Imperfect. Vulnerable to all forms of corruption.
        But the Thunderhead was incorruptible. Not only that, but its
        algorithms were built on the full sum of human knowledge. All the
        time and money wasted on political posturing, the lives lost in wars,
        the populations abused by despots—all gone the moment the
        Thunderhead was handed power. Of course, the politicians,
        dictators, and warmongers weren’t happy, but their voices, which
        had always seemed so loud and intimidating, were suddenly
        insignificant. The emperor not only had no clothes, turns out he had
        no testicles either.
        The Thunderhead quite literally knew everything. When and where
        to build roads; how to eliminate waste in food distribution and thus
        end hunger; how to protect the environment from the ever-growing
        human population. It created jobs, it clothed the poor, and it
        established the World Code. Now, for the first time in history, law
        was no longer the shadow of justice, it was justice.
        The Thunderhead gave us a perfect world. The utopia that our
        ancestors could only dream of is our reality.
        There was only one thing the Thunderhead was not given authority
        over.
        The Scythedom.
        When it was decided that people needed to die in order to ease
        the tide of population growth, it was also decided that this must be
        the responsibility of humans. Bridge repair and urban planning could
        be handled by the Thunderhead, but taking a life was an act of
        conscience and consciousness. Since it could not be proven that the
        Thunderhead had either, the Scythedom was born.
        I do not regret the decision, but I often wonder if the Thunderhead
        would have done a better job.

        The Scythe Commandments
        1) Thou shalt kill.
        2) Thou shalt kill with no bias, bigotry, or malice aforethought.
        3) Thou shalt grant an annum of immunity to the beloved of those
        who accept your coming, and to anyone else you deem worthy.
        4) Thou shalt kill the beloved of those who resist.
        5) Thou shalt serve humanity for the full span of thy days, and thy
        family shall have immunity as recompense for as long as you live.
        6) Thou shalt lead an exemplary life in word and deed, and keep a
        journal of each and every day.
        7) Thou shalt kill no scythe beyond thyself.
        8) Thou shalt claim no earthly possessions, save thy robes, ring, and
        journal.
        9) Thou shalt have neither spouse nor spawn.
        10) Thou shalt be beholden to no laws beyond these.
        Once a year I fast and ponder the commandments. In truth, I
        ponder them daily, but once a year I allow them to be my sole
        sustenance. There is genius in their simplicity. Before the
        Thunderhead, governments had constitutions and massive tomes of
        laws—yet even then, they were forever debated and challenged and
        manipulated. Wars were fought over the different interpretations of
        the same doctrine.
        When I was much more naive, I thought that the simplicity of the
        scythe commandments made them impervious to scrutiny. From
        whatever angle you approached them, they looked the same. Over
        my many years, I’ve been both bemused and horrified by how
        malleable and elastic they can be. The things we scythes attempt to
        justify. The things that we excuse.
        In my early days, there were several scythes still alive who were
        present when the commandments were formed. Now none remain,
        all having invoked commandment number seven. I wish I would have
        asked them how the commandments came about. What led to each
        one? How did they decide upon the wording? Were there any that
        were jettisoned before the final ten were written in stone?
        And why number ten?
        Of all the commandments, number ten gives me the greatest pause
        for thought. For to put oneself above all other laws is a fundamental
        recipe for disaster.

        In my early years, I wondered why it was so rare to catch a scythe
        out of his or her robes and in common street clothes. It’s a rule in
        some places, but not in MidMerica. Here it is just an accepted
        practice, although rarely violated. Then, as I settled in, it occurred to
        me why it must be. For our own peace of mind, we scythes must
        retain a certain level of separation from the rest of humanity. Even in
        the privacy of my own home I find myself wearing only the simple
        lavender frock that I wear beneath my robes.
        Some would call this behavior aloof. I suppose on some level it is,
        but for me it’s more the need to remind myself that I am “other.”
        Certainly, most uniformed positions allow the wearers to have a
        separate life. Peace officers and firefighters, for instance, are only
        partially defined by their job. In the off hours they wear jeans and Tshirts. They have barbecues for neighbors and coach their children in
        sports. But to be a scythe means you are a scythe every hour of every
        day. It defines you to the core of your being, and only in dreams is
        one free of the yoke.
        Yet even in dreams I often find myself gleaning. . . .

        Scythes are supposed to have a keen appreciation of death, yet there
        are some things that are beyond even our comprehension.
        The woman I gleaned today asked me the oddest question.
        “Where do I go now?” she asked.
        “Well,” I explained calmly, “your memories and life-recording are
        already stored in the Thunderhead, so it won’t be lost. Your body is
        returned to the Earth in a manner determined by your next of kin.”
        “Yes, I know all that,” she said. “But what about me?”
        The question perplexed me. “As I said, your memory construct will
        exist in the Thunderhead. Loved ones will be able to talk to it, and
        your construct will respond.”
        “Yes,” she said, getting a bit agitated, “but what about me?”
        I gleaned her then. Only after she was gone did I say, “I don’t
        know.”

        There’s a poem by Honorable Scythe Socrates—one of the first
        scythes. He wrote many poems, but this one has grown to be my
        personal favorite.
        Have not a hand in the blade with abandon,
        Cull from the fold all the brazen and bold,
        For a dog who just might,
        Love the bark and the bite,
        Is a carrion raven, the craven of old.
        It reminds me that in spite of our lofty ideals and the many
        safeguards to protect the Scythedom from corruption and depravity,
        we must always be vigilant, because power comes infected with the
        only disease left to us: the virus called human nature. I fear for us all
        if scythes begin to love what they do.

        Was there ever a time when people weren’t plagued with boredom?
        A time when motivation wasn’t so hard to come by? When I look at
        news archives from the Age of Mortality, it seems people had more
        reasons to do the things they did. Life was about forging time, not just
        passing time.
        And those news reports—how exciting they were. Filled with all
        nature of criminal activity. Your neighbor could be a salesperson of
        illegal chemicals of recreation. Ordinary people would take life
        without the permission of society. Angry individuals would take
        possession of vehicles they didn’t own, then lead law enforcement
        officers in dangerous pursuits on uncontrolled roadways.
        We do have the unsavories nowadays, but they do little more than
        drop occasional pieces of litter and move shop items to places they
        don’t belong. No one rages against the system anymore. At most,
        they just glare at it a bit.
        Perhaps this is why the Thunderhead still allows a measured
        amount of economic inequality. It could certainly make sure that
        everyone had equal wealth—but that would just add to the plague of
        boredom that afflicts the immortal. Although we all have what we
        need, we’re still allowed to strive for the things we want. Of course,
        no one strives like they did in mortal days, when the inequality was
        so great people would actually steal from one another—sometimes
        ending lives in the process.
        I wouldn’t want the return of crime, but I do tire of we scythes
        being the sole purveyors of fear. It would be nice to have
        competition.

        We are not the same beings we once were.
        Consider our inability to grasp literature and most entertainment
        from the mortal age. To us, the things that stirred mortal human
        emotions are incomprehensible. Only stories of love pass through our
        post-mortal filter, yet even then, we are baffled by the intensity of
        longing and loss that threatens those mortal tales of love.
        We could blame it on our emo-nanites limiting our despair, but it
        runs far deeper than that. Mortals fantasized that love was eternal
        and its loss unimaginable. Now we know that neither is true. Love
        remained mortal, while we became eternal. Only scythes can
        equalize that, but everyone knows the chance of being gleaned in
        this, or even the next millennium is so low as to be ignored.
        We are not the same beings we once were.
        So then, if we are no longer human, what are we?

        Sometimes, when the weight of my job becomes overwhelming, I
        begin to lament all the things lost when we conquered death. I think
        about religion and how, once we became our own saviors, our own
        gods, most faiths became irrelevant. What must it have been like to
        believe in something greater than oneself? To accept imperfection
        and look to a rising vision of all we could never be? It must have
        been comforting. It must have been frightening. It must have lifted
        people from the mundane, but also justified all sorts of evil. I often
        wonder if the bright benefit of belief outweighed the darkness its
        abuse could bring.
        There are the tone cults, of course, dressing in sackcloth and
        worshiping sonic vibrations—but like so many things in our world,
        they seek to imitate what once was. Their rituals are not to be taken
        seriously. They exist merely to make the passing time feel meaningful
        and profound.
        Lately I’ve been preoccupied with a tone cult in my neighborhood.
        I went into their gathering place the other day. I was there to glean
        one of the cult’s congregants—a man who had not yet turned his first
        corner. They were intoning what they called “the resonant frequency
        of the universe.” One of them told me that the sound is alive and that
        harmonizing with it brings inner peace. I wonder, when they look at
        the great tuning fork that stands as the symbol of their faith, if they
        truly believe it to be a symbol of power or are they just joining in a
        communal joke?

        The quota system has worked for over two hundred years, and
        although it fluctuates region to region, it makes it crystal clear what
        each scythe’s responsibility to the world is. Of course it’s all based on
        averages—we can go days or even weeks without gleaning—but we
        must meet our quota before the next conclave. There are those eager
        ones who glean early, and find themselves with little to do as
        conclave draws near. There are those who procrastinate and have to
        hurry toward the end. Both those approaches lead to sloppiness and
        unintentional bias.
        I often wonder if the quota will ever change, and if so, how much.
        Population growth is still off the charts, but it’s balanced by the
        Thunderhead’s ability to provide for an ever-increasing population.
        Renewable resources, subsurface dwellings, artificial islands, and all
        without there ever being any less green or a sense of overcrowding.
        We have mastered this world, and yet protected it in a way that our
        forefathers could scarcely have dreamed.
        But all things are limited. While the Thunderhead does not
        interfere with the Scythedom, it does suggest the number of scythes
        there should be in the world. Currently there are approximately five
        million people gleaned per year worldwide—a tiny fraction of the
        death rate in the Age of Mortality, and nowhere near enough to
        balance population growth. I shudder to think how many more
        scythes it would take, and how many gleanings would be required, if
        we ever need to curb population growth altogether.

        I do believe people still fear death, but only one-one hundredth as
        much as they used to. I say that because, based on current quotas, a
        person’s chance of being gleaned within the next one hundred years
        is only 1 percent. Which means the chance that a child born today
        will be gleaned between now and their five thousandth year on Earth
        is only 50 percent.
        Of course, since we no longer count the years numerically, aside
        from children and adolescents, no one knows how old anyone is
        anymore—sometimes not even themselves. These days people
        roughly know within a decade or two. At the writing of this, I can tell
        you that I am somewhere between one hundred sixty and one
        hundred eighty years old, although I don’t enjoy looking my age. Like
        everyone else, I turn the corner on occasion and set my biological
        age back substantially—but like many scythes, I don’t set it back past
        the age of forty. Only scythes that are actually young like to look
        young.
        To date, the oldest living human being is somewhere around three
        hundred, but only because we are still so close to the Age of
        Mortality. I wonder what life will be like a millennium from now,
        when the average age will be nearer to one thousand. Will we all be
        renaissance children, skilled at every art and science, because we’ve
        had the time to master them? Or will boredom and slavish routine
        plague us even more than it does today, giving us less of a reason to
        live limitless lives? I dream of the former, but suspect the latter.

        There are times I long for a relationship with the Thunderhead. I
        suppose we always want what we can’t have. Others can call on the
        Thunderhead for advice, ask it to resolve disputes. Some rely on it as
        a confidant, for it’s known to have a compassionate, impartial ear,
        and never gossips. The Thunderhead is the world’s best listener.
        But not for scythes. For us, the Thunderhead is eternally silent.
        We have full access to its wealth of knowledge, of course. The
        Scythedom uses the Thunderhead for countless tasks—but to us, it’s
        simply a database. A tool, nothing more. As an entity—as a mind—
        the Thunderhead does not exist for us.
        And yet it does, and we know it.
        Estrangement from the collective consciousness of humanity’s
        wisdom is just one more thing that sets scythes apart from others.
        The Thunderhead must see us. It must be aware of the Scythedom’s
        petty bickering, and growing corruption, even though it has pledged
        noninterference. Does it despise us scythes, but abides us because it
        has to? Or does it simply choose not to think of us at all? And which
        is worse—to be despised, or to be ignored?

        I think it’s wise that scythes may not glean one another. It was clearly
        implemented to prevent Byzantine grabs at power; but where power
        is concerned there are always those who find ways to grasp for it.
        I think it’s also wise that we are allowed to glean ourselves. I will
        admit there were times when I considered it. When the weight of
        responsibility felt so heavy, leaving the yoke of the world behind
        seemed a better alternative. But one thought always stayed my hand
        from committing that final act.
        If not me, who?
        Will the scythe who replaces me be as compassionate and fair?
        I can accept a world without me in it . . . but I can’t bear the
        thought of other scythes gleaning in my absence.

        I have never taken an apprentice. I simply never felt compelled to
        subject another human being to our way of life. I often wonder what
        motivates other scythes to do so. For some it is a form of vanity:
        “Learn from me and be awed because I am so wise.” For others
        perhaps it is compensation for not being allowed to have children:
        “Be my son or my daughter for a year, and I will give you power
        over life and death.” Yet for others, I imagine it is to prepare for their
        own self-gleaning. “Be the new me, so that the old me can leave this
        world satisfied.”
        I suspect, however, if I ever take on an apprentice, it will be for a
        different reason entirely.

        If you’ve ever studied mortal age cartoons, you’ll remember this one.
        A coyote was always plotting the demise of a smirking long-necked
        bird. The coyote never succeeded; instead, his plans always
        backfired. He would blow up, or get shot, or splat from a ridiculous
        height.
        And it was funny.
        Because no matter how deadly his failure, he was always back in
        the next scene, as if there were a revival center just beyond the edge
        of the animation cell.
        I’ve seen human foibles that have resulted in temporary maiming
        or momentary loss of life. People stumble into manholes, are hit by
        falling objects, trip into the paths of speeding vehicles.
        And when it happens, people laugh, because no matter how
        gruesome the event, that person, just like the coyote, will be back in
        a day or two, as good as new, and no worse—or wiser—for the
        wear.
        Immortality has turned us all into cartoons.

        I am disturbed by those who revere us far more than those who
        disdain us. Too many put us on a pedestal. Too many long to be one
        of us—and knowing that they can never be makes their longing even
        greater, for all scythes are apprenticed in their youth.
        It is either naivete in thinking that we are somehow of a higher
        order of being, or it is the product of a depraved heart—for who but
        the depraved would revel in the taking of life?
        For a time years ago, there were groups who would emulate and
        imitate us. They would fashion robes like those of scythes. They would
        wear rings that looked similar to ours. For many it was just costume
        play, but some would actually pretend to be scythes, fooling others,
        granting false immunity. Everything short of gleaning.
        There are laws against impersonating workers in any profession,
        but no law preventing anyone from impersonating a scythe. Since the
        Thunderhead has no jurisdiction over the Scythedom, it cannot pass
        any laws concerning us. It was an unforeseen glitch in the separation
        of Scythe and State.
        However, it wasn’t a glitch for long. In the Year of the Stingray, at
        the Sixty-Third World Conclave, it was decided that all such
        imposters shall be gleaned on sight, publicly, and most violently.
        While one might expect such an edict to produce a bloodbath, very
        few gleanings ever took place. Once word got out, the posers shed
        their false robes and vanished into the woodwork of the world. To
        this day the edict remains, but rarely needs to be invoked, because
        few are foolish enough to impersonate a scythe.
        And yet now and again, I hear at conclave the rare tale of a
        scythe coming face to face with an imposter and having to glean
        them. Usually the conversation is about the inconvenience of it. How
        the scythe must then track down the imposter’s family to grant
        immunity and such.
        But I wonder more about the imposter. What was it they hoped to
        achieve? Was it the lure of the forbidden? Were they enticed by the
        danger of being caught? Or did they simply wish to leave this life so
        badly that they chose one of the few direct paths to annihilation?

        In the business of death, we scythes have no competition. Unless, of
        course, you consider fire. Fire kills just as swiftly and completely as a
        scythe’s blade. It’s frightening, but also somehow comforting to know
        that there’s one thing the Thunderhead can’t fix. One type of damage
        that revival centers are powerless to undo. Once one’s goose is
        cooked, it is truly and permanently cooked.
        Death by fire is the only natural death left. It almost never
        happens, though. The Thunderhead monitors heat on every inch of
        the planet, and the fighting of fires often begins before one can even
        smell smoke. There are safety systems in every home and every office
        building, with multiple levels of redundancy, just in case. The more
        extreme tone cults try to burn their deadish, to make it permanent, but
        ambu-drones usually get to them first.
        Isn’t it good to know that we are all safe from the threat of the
        inferno? Except, of course, when we’re not.

        There is no official media coverage of gleanings, much to the chagrin
        of the more publicity-minded scythes. Not even large-scale gleanings
        get on the news. Even so, plenty of personal pictures and videos of
        gleanings are uploaded to the Thunderhead, providing a guerilla
        record—which is so much more exciting and enticing than anything
        official.
        Notoriety and infamy quickly evolve into celebrity and fame for
        scythes—and the most brazen acts harden further into legend. Some
        scythes find the fame addictive, and seek greater and greater
        celebrity. Others would rather remain anonymous.
        I cannot deny that I am legend. Not for the simple gleanings I do
        now, but for the audacious ones I did more than a hundred and fifty
        years ago. As if I weren’t already immortal enough, I am further
        immortalized on collectible cards. The newer ones are prized by
        schoolchildren. The older ones are worth a fortune to hard-core
        collectors, regardless of the condition.
        I am legend. Yet every day I wish that I was not.

        I fought against the purge. There are things I’ve done that I am not
        proud of, but I am very proud that I fought against that.
        I can’t recall which scythe began that odious campaign to glean
        only those who were born mortal, but it spread throughout each
        regional Scythedom, a viral idea in a post-viral time. “Shouldn’t those
        who were born to expect death be the sole subjects of gleaning?”
        went the popular wisdom. But it was bigotry masquerading as
        wisdom. Selfishness posing as enlightenment. And not enough
        scythes argued—because those born in the post-mortal age found
        mortal-borns to be too uncomfortably different in the way they
        thought, and in the way they lived their lives. “Let them die with the
        age that bore them,” cried the post-mortal purists in the Scythedom.
        In the end it was deemed a gross violation of the second
        commandment, and all those scythes who participated in the purge
        were severely disciplined—but by then it was too late to undo what
        had been done. We lost our ancients. We lost our elders. We lost
        our living lifeline to the past. There are still mortal-borns around, but
        they hide their age and their history, for fear of being targeted again.
        Yes, I fought the purge—but the Thunderhead did not. By its own
        law of noninterference in scythe affairs, it could do nothing to stop
        the purge. All it could do was bear witness. The Thunderhead
        allowed us to make that costly mistake, leaving the Scythedom to
        wallow in its own regret to this very day.
        I often wonder, should the Scythedom run entirely off the rails and
        decide to glean all of humanity in a grand suicide of global
        gleaning, would the Thunderhead break its noninterference law and
        stop it? Or would it bear witness again as we destroyed ourselves,
        leaving nothing behind but a living cloud of our knowledge,
        accomplishments, and so-called wisdom?
        Would the Thunderhead grieve our passing, I wonder? And if so,
        would it grieve as the child who has lost a parent, or as the parent
        who could not save a petulant child from its own poor choices?

        While there are only ten hard-and-fast laws to the Scythedom, there
        are many accepted conventions. The most darkly ironic is the
        understanding that no one may be gleaned who wishes to be
        gleaned.
        The idea of truly wishing to end one’s own life is a concept
        completely foreign to most post-mortals, because we can’t experience
        the level of pain and despair that so seasoned the Age of Mortality.
        Our emo-nanites prevent us from plunging so deep. Only scythes,
        who can turn off our emotional nanites, can ever reach an impasse
        with our own existence.
        And yet . . .
        There was once a woman who knocked on my door requesting
        that I glean her. I never turn away visitors, so I let her in and listened
        to her story. Her husband of more than ninety years was gleaned five
        years prior. Now she wanted to be with him, wherever he was, and
        if he was nowhere, then at least they would be nowhere together.
        “I’m not unhappy,” she told me. “I’m just . . . done.”
        But immortality, by definition, means that we are never done,
        unless a scythe determines it to be so. We are no longer temporary;
        only our feelings are.
        I saw no interminable stagnation in this woman, so instead of
        gleaning her I had her kiss my ring. The immunity was immediate
        and irrevocable—so she could no longer entertain thoughts of being
        gleaned for a full year.
        I ran into her perhaps a decade later. She had turned the corner,
        resetting back to her late twenties. She had remarried and was
        expecting a child. She thanked me for being wise enough to know
        she was not “done” at all.
        Although I accepted her thanks graciously and felt good about it in
        the moment, I had trouble sleeping that night. To this day, I still can’t
        understand why.

        . . . Yet even in dreams I often find myself gleaning.
        I have one dream that recurs far too often. I am walking on an
        unfamiliar street that I feel I should know, but don’t. I have a
        pitchfork, which I’ve never used in real life; its awkward tines are not
        well suited for gleaning, and when it strikes it reverberates, giving off
        a sound that is something between ringing and moaning, like the
        numbing vibration of a Tonist bident.
        There is a woman before me whom I must glean. I jab at her, yet
        the pitchfork fails to do the job. Her wounds heal instantaneously.
        She is not upset or frightened. Nor is she amused. She is simply
        resigned to stand there, allowing me to futilely attempt to end her life.
        She opens her mouth to speak, but her voice is soft and her words
        are drowned out by the fork’s ghastly moans, so I never hear her.
        And I always wake up screaming.

        The longer we live, the quicker the days seem to pass. How
        troublesome that is when we live forever. A year seems to pass in a
        matter of weeks. Decades fly with no milestones to mark them. We
        become settled in the inconsequential drudgery of our lives, until
        suddenly we look at ourselves in the mirror and see a face we barely
        recognize begging us to turn a corner and be young again.
        But are we truly young when we turn the corner?
        We hold the same memories, the same habits, the same
        unrealized dreams. Our bodies may be spry and limber, but toward
        what end? No end. Never an end.
        I do believe mortals strived more heartily toward their goals,
        because they knew that time was of the essence. But us? We can put
        things off far more effectively than those doomed to die, because
        death has become the exception instead of the rule.
        The stagnation that I so fervently glean on a daily basis seems an
        epidemic that only grows. There are times I feel I am fighting a losing
        battle against an old-fashioned apocalypse of the living dead.

        It is with bittersweet joy that I watch the bejeweling of new junior
        scythes at the end of each conclave. Joy, because they are our hope,
        and still kindle the idealism of the first scythes in their hearts. But
        bittersweet because I know that someday they will become so tired
        and jaded they will take their own lives, as all those first scythes
        eventually did.
        Yet each time the new scythes are bejeweled, I still rejoice,
        because it allows me, if only for a few glorious moments, to believe
        that we will all choose to live forever.
