        discription: Faraday has short gray hair with a salt and pepper goatee. Faraday's biological age is around 60 years old.
      </p>
        personality: Faraday is fair, logical, and compassionate. He was a respected scythe within the scythedom who held old guard ideals by placing himself at an ethical and morally high ground. He treated gleaning as a sacred service and dedicated much of his time to researching and gleaning people. He also made sure all his apprentices developed their moral compasses in addition to learning the methods of killcraft.

        way of gleaning: Scythe Faraday believed in using accidental death statistics from the Age of Mortality to choose his victims. For instance, he chose to glean a person because many people used to die saving their pets from drowning in rivers. And although Faraday took his vows as a scythe very seriously, he didn't always follow the rules. Once, when a man fought back—which, by law, means the scythe must glean the man's whole family—Faraday instead granted the man's wife and children immunity. He was very creative with his gleaning methods, and never repeated the same method twice. He preferred to see each person he would glean as an individual deserving of an end that is unique. He also researched his candidates deeply. His style was described as: "swift, painless, efficient." He gave his gleaning subjects the chance to write a letter to their family members and the promise to deliver it to them. He attended the funeral of all the people he gleaned. Since the scythedom was taken down, Scythe Faraday currently performs sympathy gleanings in ways that are painless to the dying.
