        discription: Scythe Goddard has Spanic leanings. He had dark hair, which was shorter than when he was on Mars. Physically he maintained himself between thirty and forty, but was biologically in his seventies, pushing eighty by The Toll. When Rand substituted the rest of his body with Tygerâ€™s he got his voice, a muscular build, teenage hormones, muscle memory, and an uneven skin tone due to being a fusion of two diferent bodies.
      </p>
        personality: Goddard is an intelligent and incredibly dangerous man. His ego is enormous, and whenever it is threatened, his temper explodes. He's materialistic, showy, and isn't afraid to bend rules to get away with his extravagance (justifying it by claiming that they are donated or lent to him for the duration of his usage) or for other reasons to serve his needs and desires, (such as giving Rowan his ring to grant immunity because he was becoming tired of holding out his hand). Goddard enjoys killing people, and is incredibly sadistic in his gleanings and outside of them. When a businessman on a plane he intended to glean everyone on board showed bravery and decisive decision-making, he 'rewarded' them with the 'honor' of choosing the order of the peoples' gleanings. When the businessman advised the other passengers to end themselves before the bloodthirsty elegy could, and did so himself, he seemed annoyed; the prey he had wanted to watch squirm in agony found a loophole. He doesn't value people's lives, and is willing to sacrifice people for his own amusement and ends. An example is when Goddard, through Rand, proposed that Citra or Rowan would have to glean who wasn't ordained. This was to mess with Faraday. [3] When he had Rowan as an apprentice and wanted him ordained, he was willing to use his blackmail on Xenocrates to discredit Citra by false accusations. He also was willing to murder an innocent child (Esme) to maintain his blackmail. Despite his sadistic behavior and promotion of this behavior, he's good at convincing people. Goddard often gets his way by doing so. He's mentioned to have a way of worming into your mind, and making you question whether he's really wrong. He does things unplanned, and he pretends that his plan existed the entire time, persuading people into believing it. After taking over Tyger's body, Goddard is erratic and prone to rages beyond his old norm. He makes impulsive decisions in his fury, and tries to explain away the results as intentional. Despite this, Goddard is still intelligent and astute, as seen when he memorized every control on the Martian power core's dashboard when no one else knew much about it. He also was decent at mind games, being able to play on a similar playing field as Xenocrates when he was younger. At his core, Goddard has narcissistic tendencies, and holds on to grudges (such as Xenocrates causing everyone to laugh at Goddard, which he brought up about half a week later) most wouldn't. He, despite describing himself as 'a man not easily brought to fury' even before his revival, is shown to be temperamental and easily angered (such as when Volta points out that they have already hit their quotas). Some of his sore points include the gleaning quota and being scrutinized. Goddard treats most everyone in his life as a servant, including Rand (who revivef him) and described her decision to grab his head as 'having the prescience of mind'. He is power-hungry and desires there to be one world scythedom, under Goddard himself. Goddard also defined himself by what he opposed, which caused him to gain a lot of enemies.

        way of gleaning: As Scythe Goddard is the master of mass gleanings, him and his crew glean in large amounts, claiming it is to emulate natural disasters. Scythe Goddard's methods had often been under scrutiny because of his sadistic ways. He gleaned in mass gleanings. He refrained from gleaning people months at a time, then proceed to glean in places where large amounts of people appear. He repeatedly admitted to finding joy in his gleanings and was unashamed of this. Goddard is also mentioned to go after rocket scientists especially. He was fond of blades and guns. He never used poisons that weren't on weapons, saying that they were boring. The gleanings were always spectacles. In his journals he said that he did so to remain connected to mortals and that his victims deserved a spectacular end, but really it was because he enjoyed it.
