      <p>I am not a man easily brought to fury, but how dare the old-guard
        scythes presume to dictate my behavior? Let every last one of them
        glean themselves, and we can be done with their self-loathing,
        sanctimonious ways. I am a man who chooses to glean with pride,
        not shame. I choose to embrace life, even as I deal death. Make no
        mistake—we scythes are above the law because we deserve to be. I
        see a day when new scythes will be chosen not because of some
        esoteric moral high ground, but because they enjoy the taking of life.
        After all, this is a perfect world—and in a perfect world, don’t we all
        have the right to love what we do?
        —From the gleaning journal of H.S. Goddard

        As a young man, I marveled at the stupidity and hypocrisy of the
        mortal age. In those days, the purposeful act of ending human life
        was considered the most heinous of crimes. How ridiculous! I know
        how hard it is to imagine that what is now humanity’s highest calling
        was once considered a crime. How small-minded and hypocritical
        mortal man was, for even as they despised the enders of life, they
        loved nature—which, in those days, took every human life ever
        conceived. Nature deemed that to be born was an automatic
        sentence to death, and then brought about that death with vicious
        consistency.
        We changed that.
        We are now a force greater than nature.
        For this reason, scythes must be as loved as a glorious mountain
        vista, as revered as a redwood forest, and as respected as an
        approaching storm.

        The business of the Thunderhead is no business of mine. The
        Thunderhead’s purpose is to sustain humanity. Mine is to mold it. The
        Thunderhead is the root, and I am the shears, pruning the limbs into
        fine form, keeping the tree vital. We are both necessary. And we are
        mutually exclusive.
        I do not miss my so-called relationship with the Thunderhead—nor
        do the junior scythes I’ve come to see as disciples. The absence of the
        Thunderhead’s uninvited intrusions into our lives is a blessing, for it
        allows us to live without a safety net. Without the crutch of a higher
        power. I am the highest power I know, and I like it that way.
        And as for my gleaning methods, which, now and then, have
        been brought under scrutiny, I say merely this: Is it not the job of the
        gardener to shape the tree as much as possible? And shouldn’t
        branches that begin to reach unreasonably high be the first to be
        pruned?

        Gleanings should be iconic. They should be memorable. They should
        have the legendary power of the greatest battles of the mortal age,
        passed down by word of mouth, becoming as immortal as we are.
        That is, after all, why we scythes are here. To keep us connected to
        our past. Tethered to mortality. Yes, most of us will live forever, but
        some of us, thanks to the Scythedom, will not. For those who will be
        gleaned, do we not, at the very least, owe them a spectacular end?
        —From the gleaning journal of H.S. Goddard
      </p>
      <p>
        So many of our archaic traditions and rules need to be challenged.
        The founders, as well-meaning as they were, still suffered from a
        mortal mentality, having been so close to the Age of Mortality. They
        could not foresee the needs of the Scythedom.
        I would first take on the concept of a quota. It’s absurd that we are
        free to determine our method and criteria for gleaning, but not the
        number of gleanings we accomplish. We are hamstrung every minute
        of every day, because we must always consider whether we are
        gleaning too much or too little. Better to allow us to glean at our own
        complete discretion. That way, scythes who glean too little will not be
        punished, because scythes who have a healthier gleaning appetite
        will make up for their shortcomings. In this way, we can help one
        another, and isn’t helping our fellow scythes a good thing for all of
        us?
